# Security Implementation: Game Session Tokens

This update implements a secure session token system to prevent score manipulation in the Doodle Jump game.

## Implementation Overview

1. **Game Session Tokens**: Each game session now generates a unique cryptographic token that is required for score submission.

2. **Token Lifecycle**:
   - Token is generated at game start using a cryptographically secure method
   - Token is stored in HTTP-only cookies (inaccessible from JavaScript)
   - Token is validated server-side when submitting scores
   - Token is single-use and expires after being used or after 10 minutes

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Tokens are generated using `window.crypto` for cryptographic randomness
   - Tokens are stored server-side with address association
   - Validation happens outside the client-side JavaScript environment
   - Tokens are sent in headers for validation rather than in the request body

## How It Works

1. When a game starts:
   - A unique 256-bit random token is generated
   - The token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie that JavaScript can't access
   - Token is registered with the server, associating it with the current wallet address and game ID

2. When a game ends:
   - The token is included in the game over message to the parent window
   - The token is included in the request headers when saving the score
   - Server validates the token matches the one registered for this session
   - After successful validation, the token is invalidated

3. Server-side validation:
   - Verifies token exists
   - Checks token matches the expected wallet address
   - Ensures token hasn't been used before
   - Invalidates the token after use

## Security Benefits

- Prevents score manipulation through browser console
- Each score submission requires a valid session token
- Tokens can't be reused, preventing duplicate submissions
- Tokens expire quickly, limiting the window for attacks
- The secure token system runs alongside existing blockchain transactions

## API Endpoints

- `/api/register-session-token`: Registers a new session token
- `/api/validate-session-token`: Validates a token before accepting a score

## Additional Considerations

- In production, replace the in-memory token store with Redis or a database
- Consider adding rate limiting to prevent token request flooding
- Add monitoring for unusual patterns of token generation/validation attempts
