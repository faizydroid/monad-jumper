Where 30%-40% of the platforms have been taken out, and your points get 1.5x or doubled, and random items or power-ups drop from the sky, or perhaps as you kill the monsters. And they can either be a buff or a debuff.

1.) Very easy to understand and play. Everyone will like it for sure.
2.) The design is simple but catchy.
3.) Playing the game was like my break from Monad testnet.

Dislike:
1.) Sometimes I play longer than I should be playing specially when I can't pass my previous record.
2.) I don't like approving transactions every single game. Sometimes my character dies after just couple of jumps and I had to approve transactions again.","I hope Jumpnad team will remove the approval of transaction every single game. I really don't know if there is a workaround for this, so I don't know what to suggest.
